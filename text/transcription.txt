one of the things that is really unique and special about computer science degree in Cambridge is that you're going to be told by cutting edge world leaders in their own fields who are really excited about their work the cool sometimes involves pretty much anything that you can think of to do with computers and technology from any foundation in the rest of the material on automation my second one extreme too intense finally projects 
I've always been fascinated by the way that computers can solve problems both for myself and for other people and that's that's really really interesting to me so it seems like a natural thing to study when I went to university 
I've always enjoyed doing logic puzzles small challenges and also I wanted to learn everything that I could about computers which I think computer science embodies perfectly but also I wanted to be in a really good time the environment which Cambridge offers and have all these brilliant minds around me computer science at king prince seemed just the right course 
of course is structured so that we teach our students the theoretical background that underpins the principles of computer science but also with the hands on experience of putting back the reticle knowledge into practice 
my favorite experience on the coast so far has been a great project to my second yeah LH I worked with a group of people to produce a piece of software for a company I got to present the project to all the of the students and the people from other companies and it was really exciting 
the employability prospects for our graduates %HESITATION I really first rate we're also a very internal real play so lots of our graduates go on to found their own companies and startups one thing that we find out when we start studying the sciences that this is a subject that opens up so many different doors %HESITATION we can we can work in many different fields doing many different things what I would like to do is go what for software companies and maybe with that learn some skills on my own so I can I can stop by and in the future and solve problems my own way 
by applying for masters and then going on to do research either here at the lab for industrial research I feel I will be able to bring a contribution to the field of computer science 
on the main screen computer science ends up being about solving really hard problems in the best possible way so if there's one key thing that you can come away from the times degree in computer science with its being a really really good problem solver we are genuinely interested in people who are self motivated and passionate about technology if you're curious then come to us and we will teach you the theoretical and the practical ways of how you can build systems that are going to make our world a better place
